We played PCC 2024 Finals in Air University Islamabad on 13-14 Nov. It gathered teams from all over Pakistan and was a very competitive experience. The main highlight this year was their flagship ShowDown event. Which was a 1v1 elimination-based competition. All teams competed against each other in Pwn+Rev and Web in multiple rounds. We ended up in finals of ShowDown and lost in the Sudden Death round to team SUD03RS. The CTF was held the next day and was extremely competitive as well. We were 2nd when team Gryffins solved a challenge at the last moment, replacing us by a margin of 4 points. Overall, It was a healthy, top notch, quality event. Here are the writeups of Pwn challenges that we solved in ShowDown and CTF. All of these challenges was made by the great TheFlash2k and he did an amazing job.

P.S. We were the only team to solve all pwn challenges in both competitions except ShowDown finals.
